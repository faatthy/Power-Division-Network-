Momentum MomEngine_64 2020.00.283 (*) built: Jul 17 2019
Copyright  1992 - 2019 Keysight Technologies
Simulation started on: Tue Apr 25 17:41:41 2023
Simulation Mode: uW
Substrate valid
Using the minimal snap distance of 0.0004 mm
(4 layout resolution points) for layout healing.

--- WARNING -------------------------------------------------------------------

Layout healing changed the layout. The actual
highest aggregate snap distance was 0.0001 mm.
Further details have been written to the DRC
report.

--- WARNING -------------------------------------------------------------------

One or more pins are not fully connected to a
conductive piece of mask layout.
Only FEM simulations are able to process such
pins.
Further details have been written to the layout
processing report.

--- ERROR ---------------------------------------------------------------------

At least one port pin or bondwire end is not
fully connected to a conductive part of the
design (see the layout processing report for
details).
This setup is invalid for a Momentum simulation.
