Using the minimal snap distance of 0.0004 mm
(4 layout resolution points) for layout healing.

--- WARNING -------------------------------------------------------------------

Layout healing changed the layout. The actual
highest aggregate snap distance was 0.0001 mm.
Further details have been written to the DRC
report.

--- WARNING -------------------------------------------------------------------

Pin "P1" on mask 1 is not fully connected to a
conductive piece of mask layout.
Only FEM simulations are able to process such
pins.

Generating mesh at 10 GHz...

--- ERROR ---------------------------------------------------------------------

At least one port pin or bondwire end is not
fully connected to a conductive part of the
design (see the layout processing report for
details).
This setup is invalid for a Momentum simulation.
