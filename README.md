## System Results
●     Input and output matching 
We’ve achieved values as high as -200 dB for Return Loss in the ideal lumped implementation in 
both networks and as high as -40 dB in the microstrip double section BLC at the center frequency. 
We’ve managed to cover bands as large as 1.723 GHz in the M-WPD design. We’ve also managed 
to cover bands as large as 0.982 GHz in the triple section BLC design. That marks the start of a 
trend where the lumped implementation achieves much ‘sharper’ results. As, it produces very 
efficient results but in a bandwidth much shorter than that of the microstrip implementation.  

●     Isolation between output ports 
 We’ve achieved values as high as -230 dB for Isolation between output ports in the ideal lumped 
implementation of the M-WPD and as high as -40 dB in the single section BLC at the center 
frequency.   

●     Equal power division ratio 
 We’ve achieved values for Excess Insertion Loss (EIL) as small as 0.01 dB in the ideal lumped 
implementation in both networks and as small as 0.096 dB for the microstrip M-WPD at the center 
frequency. We succeeded in covering bands as large as 3.5 GHz of magnitude balance in the M
WPD design. We’ve also covered bands as large as 0.56 GHz of magnitude balance in triple section 
BLC design. 
 
●     Orthogonal phase relation between output signals 
 We’ve achieved values of phase imbalance as small as 0.11o at the center frequency using the 
microstrip single section BLC design. The lumped implementation also achieved a perfectly 
orthogonal phase relation between the output signals at the center frequency. We’ve managed to 
cover bands as large as 0.982 GHz using the microstrip triple section BLC design. 
We finally choose the microstrip double section BLC to serve our application, as it achieves a 
respectable balance between the specifications we’ve set out to meet in terms of performance and 
bandwidth.
